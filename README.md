## Developed by
Victor is a collaborative effort. I am responsible for all aspects related to telebot, while the logic behind the program is handled by the OpenAI GPT language model. The bot is hosted on [Railway](https://railway.app/) servers.

## Features
- **Graph Types:** Victor can generate the following types of graphs:
  - Histograms
  - Pie charts
  - Line graphs

- **Interactive Examples:** Users can access interactive examples to understand the input format for each graph type.

- **Integration with Telegram:** Victor operates seamlessly within the Telegram messaging platform.

## How to Use
1. Start the bot by sending the "/start" command.
2. Choose the type of graph you want to create from the available options.
3. Input the values as prompted by the bot, following the specified format.
4. Victor will generate the graph and send it as a photo.

## Examples
- To build a histogram: Send values separated by commas, labels separated by commas, and the graph title separated by a semicolon. Example: `20, 30, 50; Label 1, Label 2, Label 3; Graph Title`

- To build a scatter plot: Send X-axis values, Y-axis values, and the graph title separated by a semicolon. Example: `20, 30, 50; 30, 50, 20; Graph Title`
